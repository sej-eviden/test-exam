{"title":"Topic 001 Question 233","body":["A SysOps administrator must ensure that a company's Amazon EC2 instances auto scale as expected. The SysOps administrator configures an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hook to send an event to Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events), which then invokes an AWS Lambda function to configure the EC2 instances. When the configuration is complete, the Lambda function calls the complete-lifecycle-action event to put the EC2 instances into service. In testing, the SysOps administrator discovers that the Lambda function is not invoked when the EC2 instances auto scale.","","What should the SysOps administrator do to resolve this issue?"],"options":["Add a permission to the Lambda function so that it can be invoked by the EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule.","Change the lifecycle hook action to CONTINUE if the lifecycle hook experiences a failure or timeout.","Configure a retry policy in the EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule to retry the Lambda function invocation upon failure.","Update the Lambda function execution role so that it has permission to call the complete-lifecycle-action event."],"answer":"A","et_answer":"x"}
