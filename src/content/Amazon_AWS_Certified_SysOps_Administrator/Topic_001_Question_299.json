{"title":"Topic 001 Question 299","body":["A company has a public web application that experiences rapid traffic increases after advertisements appear on local television. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The Auto Scaling group is not keeping up with the traffic surges after an advertisement runs. The company often needs to scale out to 100 EC2 instances during the traffic surges.","","The instance startup times are lengthy because of a boot process that creates machine-specific data caches that are unique to each instance. The exact timing of when the advertisements will appear on television is not known. A SysOps administrator must implement a solution so that the application can function properly during the traffic surges.","","Which solution will meet these requirements?"],"options":["Create e warm pool. Keep enough instances in the Stopped state to meet the increased demand.","Start 100 instances. Allow the boot process to finish running. Store this data on the instance store volume before stopping the instances.","Increase the value of the instance warmup time in the scaling policy","Use predictive scaling for the Auto Scaling group."],"answer":"","et_answer":"x"}
