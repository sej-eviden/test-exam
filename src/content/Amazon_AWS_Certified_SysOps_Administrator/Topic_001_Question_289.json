The company has set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the company's on-premises data center and a workload that runs in a VPC. The company uses Amazon Route 53 for DNS on AWS. The company uses a private hosted zone to manage DNS names for a set of services that are hosted on AWS.","","The company wants the on-premises servers to use Route 53 for DNS resolution of the private hosted zone.","","Which solution will meet these requirements?"],"options":["Create a Route 53 inbound endpoint. Ensure that security groups and routing allow the traffic from the on-premises data center. Configure the DNS server on the on-premises network to conditionally forward DNS queries for the private hosted zone's domain name to the IP addresses of the inbound endpoint.","Create a Route 53 outbound endpoint. Ensure that security groups and routing allow the traffic from the VPC. Configure the DNS server on the on-premises network to conditionally forward DNS queries for the private hosted zone’s domain name to the IP addresses of the outbound endpoint.","Edit the private hosted zone in Route 53 with a TXT record that references the on-premises DNS servers. Configure the DNS server on the on-premises network to conditionally forward DNS queries for the private hosted zone’s domain name to the base of the VPC CIDR IPv4 network range, plus two.","Edit the private hosted zone in Route 53 with a PTR record that references the on-premises DNS servers. Configure the DNS server on the on-premises network to conditionally forward DNS queries for the private hosted zone’s domain name to the base of the VPC CIDR IPv4 network range, plus two."],"answer":"","et_answer":"x"}
