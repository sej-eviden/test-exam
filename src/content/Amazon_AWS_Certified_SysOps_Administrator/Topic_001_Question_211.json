{"title":"Topic 001 Question 211","body":["A company is implementing a monitoring solution that is based on machine learning. The monitoring solution consumes Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) events that are generated by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. The monitoring solution provides detection of anomalous behavior such as unanticipated scaling events and is configured as an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) API destination.","","During initial testing, the company discovers that the monitoring solution is not receiving events. However, Amazon CloudWatch is showing that the EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule is being invoked. A SysOps administrator must implement a solution to retrieve client error details to help resolve this issue.","","Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?"],"options":["Create an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) archive for the event pattern to replay the events. Increase the logging on the monitoring solution. Use replay to invoke the monitoring solution. Examine the error details.","Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue as a dead-letter queue for the target. Process the messages in the dead-letter queue to retrieve error details.","Create a second EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule for the same event pattern to target an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to invoke the monitoring solution and to record the results to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Examine the errors in the logs.","Configure the EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule to send error messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic."],"answer":"B","et_answer":"x"}
