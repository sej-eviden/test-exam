{"title": "Topic 001 Question 232", "body": ["A company is implementing a new application in a new AWS account. A VPC and subnets have been created for the application. The application has been peered to an existing VPC in another account in the same AWS Region for database access. Amazon EC2 instances will regularly be created and terminated in the application VPC, but only some of them will need access to the databases in the peered VPC over TCP port 1521.
