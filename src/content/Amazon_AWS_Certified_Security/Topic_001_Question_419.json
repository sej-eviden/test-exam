{"title":"Topic 001 Question 419","body":["A company’s security team needs to receive a notification whenever an AWS access key has not been rotated in 90 or more days. A security engineer must develop a solution that provides these notifications automatically.","","Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of effort?"],"options":["Deploy an AWS Config managed rule to run on a periodic basis of 24 hours. Select the access-keys-rotated managed rule, and set the maxAccessKeyAge parameter to 90 days. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule with an event pattern that matches the compliance type of NON_COMPLIANT from AWS Config for the managed rule. Configure EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) to send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.","Create a script to export a .csv file from the AWS Trusted Advisor check for IAM access key rotation. Load the script into an AWS Lambda function that will upload the .csv file to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an Amazon Athena table query that runs when the .csv file is uploaded to the S3 bucket. Publish the results for any keys older than 90 days by using an invocation of an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.","Create a script to download the IAM credentials report on a periodic basis. Load the script into an AWS Lambda function that will run on a schedule through Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). Configure the Lambda script to load the report into memory and to filter the report for records in which the key was last rotated at least 90 days ago. If any records are detected, send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team.","Create an AWS Lambda function that queries the IAM API to list all the users. Iterate through the users by using the ListAccessKeys operation. Verify that the value in the CreateDate field is not at least 90 days old. Send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification to the security team if the value is at least 90 days old. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to schedule the Lambda function to run each day."],"answer":"A","et_answer":"x"}
