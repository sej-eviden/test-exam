A SysOps administrator finds that some instances are experiencing a high CPU load. The Auto Scaling group cannot scale out because the company is reaching the EC2 instance service quota.", "", "The SysOps administrator needs to implement a solution that provides a notification when the company reaches 70% or more of the EC2 instance service quota.", "", "Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient manner?"], "options": ["Create an AWS Lambda function that lists the EC2 instances, counts the EC2 instances, and compares the total number against the applied quota value by using the Service Quotas API.
