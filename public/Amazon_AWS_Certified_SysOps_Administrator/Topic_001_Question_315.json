Filter the event to capture only the running state. Create an AWS Lambda function as a target of the rule. Configure the Lambda function to check the current time and the EC2 instances\u2019 tags to determine the environment type. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as a target of the Lambda function for notifications. Subscribe the IT manager's email address to the SNS topic.", "Store the EC2 instance metadata, including the environment type, in an Amazon DynamoDB table.
