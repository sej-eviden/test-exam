The web tier consists of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones. The database tier runs on an Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance.

The operations team has confirmed that the route tables are correct and that the required ports are open on all security groups.", "", "Which combination of actions should a SysOps administrator take so that the web servers can communicate with the DB instance?
